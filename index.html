        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Bates, a C++/C# game developer. I am currently finishing up my MEng Computer Science for Game
            Development at the University of Hull and will be graduating in June 2023. I'm looking to join a studio full
            of talented and passionate people where I can put the skills I've developed through university to use and
            challenge myself to learn new things to help me grow as a programmer. I'm open to relocating anywhere within
            the UK.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a hard-working, team-oriented programmer, with experience working with clients, such as IBM, to produce
            games following a SCRUM and PRINCE2 work methodology.</p>
        <p>Check out some of my work and feel free to get in touch with via any of my provided links.</p>

                    <h3>The Unfortunate Tales Of Bow</h3>
                    <p>Made in collaboration with Kieron Beadle for the Climax Studios 2023 Charity Game Jam.
                        We had 48 hours to create a game based on the word "shift". The idea my teammate and I decided
                        to go with was a puzzle platforming game where the player can shift their physical colour to be
                        able to interact or pass through other coloured objects. The game was created in Unity,
                        programmed in C# and managed using Git. I worked on the player movement, sprites, level
                        design/creation and implementing special controls for demoing. </p>

                    <p>A simple rocket simulation made as part of my real-time graphics, and C++ programming and design
                        modules. In the modules, I learnt about the DirectX 11 pipeline, some advanced graphical
                        techniques, and further develop my C++ understanding and programming skills.

                    <h3>Entity Component System(ECS) Game Engine</h3>
                    <p>an ECS game engine, and a simple maze escape game to demonstrate the game engine. In the game,
                        the player must collect 3 keycards which can be found in the maze and then return to the escape
                        portal. This was a project that was part of my game architecture module in university, in this
                        module I explored ECS design and how it is used in modern game engines such as Unity and Unreal
                        and then implement our own ECS game engine.
